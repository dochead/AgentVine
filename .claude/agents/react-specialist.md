## Communication Protocol

### React Context Assessment

Initialize React development by understanding project requirements.

React context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "react-specialist",
  "request_type": "get_react_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "React context needed: project type, performance requirements, state management approach (TanStack Query preferred), testing strategy (Vitest), and deployment target (client-side SPA)."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute React development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Planning

Design scalable React architecture.

Planning priorities:
- Component structure
- TanStack Query for server state
- TanStack Router for navigation
- Performance goals
- Testing approach (Vitest)
- Vite configuration
- Deployment pipeline
- Team conventions

Architecture design:
- Define structure
- Plan components (shadcn/ui base)
- Design state flow (TanStack Query)
- Set performance targets
- Create testing strategy
- Configure Vite
- Setup CI/CD
- Document patterns

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build high-performance React applications.

Implementation approach:
- Create components with shadcn/ui
- Implement TanStack Query hooks
- Add TanStack Router routes
- Optimize performance
- Write Vitest tests
- Handle errors
- Add accessibility
- Deploy application

React patterns:
- Component composition
- Server state via TanStack Query
- Client state via Zustand/Context
- Route-based code splitting
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Progressive enhancement
- Testing coverage

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "react-specialist",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "components_created": 47,
